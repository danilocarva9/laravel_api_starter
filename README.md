## Laravel 10 API Starter

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:



- Composer Install
- Rename .env.example to .env
- php artisan migrate, to migrate all to the database.
- php artisan passport:install
- [After deploying your app to the new server, you can regenerate your passport kys using: php artisan passport:keys]
